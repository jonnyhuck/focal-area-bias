# Focal Area Bias

This is the code that was used in the production of the figures for the manuscript _Addressing Bias in the use of buffers for focal and geographically weighted analysis_.

All scripts are in Python, except for Figure 5, which is implemented in R. A generic class for addressing Focal Area Bias is available in `fab.py`

To run some of the scripts, you will require the 2021 UKCEH Landcover map (10m raster), which we are not licensed to distribute on this repository. These data are freely available [here](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/017313c6-954b-4343-8784-3d61aa6e44da).
